Apart from the fundamentals of the NDB token, this cutting-edge token incorporates the following features:

<details>

<summary>Inflation Control</summary>

Anti-whale and burning mechanics are implemented to protect the NDB token from manipulation and keep the price at a favorable rate for holders.&#x20;

The anti-whale feature includes a wallet's size limit to avoid someone hoarding all of the tokens and a maximum transaction limit to avoid someone executing a significant sell transaction, resulting in a dramatic drop in the prices of NDB tokens.&#x20;

For example, the NDB token discourages whale sales with its anti-whale system by limiting any sell amount to a maximum of 0.125% of the circulating supply.

<details>

<summary>Automatic Liquidity Generation</summary>

Automatic liquidity generation aims to ensure long-term stability.&#x20;

Each transaction is subject to a small fee used to increase liquidity on exchanges. This expands the liquidity pool, enhancing price stability and allowing the NDB token to trade at a higher volume.&#x20;

2% of tokens are automatically transferred to the PancakeSwap's Liquidity Pool with every transaction.

<details>

<summary>Buyback and Burn</summary>

Buyback is the NDB token's hyper-deflation feature.&#x20;

When the market sees a spike in sell transactions, the token contract uses the transaction fees to repurchase and burn tokens.&#x20;

Not only do these purchasing transactions add additional value to the liquidity pool, but the burn also reduces the total circulating supply of tokens, rapidly increasing the price and avoiding large slumps.

With every transaction, the NDB token maintains a 1.5% BuyBack reserve from where the tokens are converted into Binance Coin (BNB), which are securely locked and stored in the smart contract. These BNBs are then used for strategic BuyBack and burn.

The contract buys NDB tokens, creating volume and positive price action, and then sends those tokens to the burn address, permanently removing them from circulation. This means holders of NDB tokens do continuously receive a higher overall share of distributed rewards as the circulating supply reduces over time.

<details>

<summary>Whitelist and Blacklist</summary>

NDB token uses smart contracts to store security rules and enforcement logic.&#x20;

The code of our smart contract and transfer logic follows and defines limitations by AML, reducing the risks.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Anti-sniper</strong></summary>

The anti-sniper logic identifies addresses that are buying within 100 blocks. The addresses attempting the transfer will be added to a blacklist.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Marketing</summary>

1.5% of every transaction is dedicated to marketing efforts.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Honeypot-free code</summary>

Many scam tokens act as honeypots, allowing investors to purchase but not sell tokens. All funds invested in such tokens are immediately rendered worthless. As a result, a clean BEP-20 specification is critical.&#x20;

The NDB token specifies these significantly complicated specifications and controls in the smart contract.
