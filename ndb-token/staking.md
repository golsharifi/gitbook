{% hint style="warning" %}
Before you stake NDB tokens into a Pool of any kind, you must submit the required documents for the KYC process on Nyyu or other exchanges.
{% endhint %}

By staking NDB token onto a Pool, the user will contribute to the network and the entity who owns the Pool, thus demonstrating a willingness to access the future products or services that the entity may create with us.

During the proof-of-stake, the inclusion of new proposals into our blockchain ecosystem enables people to stake their NDB tokens as the validators of the project.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
&#x20;By staking NDB tokens on different Pools, the purchasers can get NDB or Watt tokens over their staked amount as rewards for validating a block of transactions.
