The start of the pre-sale will be announced by the Company and composed of different direct or auction rounds. Each round will have an allocated set number of tokens, and the amount of offered tokens may vary in each round.

During the direct round, the sale of allocated tokens will be sold at a set price, and it will continue until the allocated token in that round ends.

During the auction rounds, the sale will last for a set time, where bidders will be able to bid for NDB tokens at or above a reserved price announced before the round opens. The minimum price of the token may increase in each round. It is important to note that in an auction, any bid to buy our tokens at the set price or above will be held until the end of each round.

Upon completion of each round of pre-sale auction, the tokens will become available to the bidder(s) with the winning bid, and the losing bids on hold will be released. The Company will have no obligation to deliver, and a bidder(s) will have no right to receive any tokens unless the Company recognizes a bidder(s) as a winner of an auction. You should continuously keep track of the threshold price and ensure your bid is consistently above the highest bid(s). The balance and transaction history will be accessible via the Nyyu.

After or during the pre-sale, the remaining percentage of the tokens will be available through crypto exchanges.
