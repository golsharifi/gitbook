# Charenji

Charenji is an application for a competitive social platform with the possibilities of interaction.

{% hint style="info" %}
Charenji is a DeFi NFT social media allowing challenges, interactions, earnings, and votes. Users can show, share, and improve their skills. The key players in this social media are challengers, challengees, judges, and other users.
{% endhint %}

> Our goal is to improve the personal best performances and inspire greater creativity. Charenji is a combination of competitive nature and video consumption. These features make it a platform that can grow.

Being a DeFi NFT Social Media allows the users to keep their videos as NFT and stay the only owner of their content. Charenji users will be able to get NFT rewards for winning the challenge. The more votes a challenge has, the higher the reward.

The NFTs can be traded in the [marketplace](../metaverse/marketplace.md). You are free to sell your NFTs earned or created in Charenji, or you can buy them from someone else.

Charenji will be the host of [NDB City elections](../metaverse/elections.md), where the candidates will be able to run their campaigns debate, and users will be educated and entertained.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Charenji application will be available for download on iOS and Android through the Apple and Google Play stores.&#x20;

There is no pricing for personal use.&#x20;

However, suppose you are an enterprise that wants to prompt events or see statistics through the Charenji application. In that case, there is a Pro version of the normal account available for a subscription fee. The Pro account enables analytics about the audience that watches your videos and features to set up sponsored events.

<summary><strong>Stories</strong></summary>

The challengers can share stories while being prepared during the challenge to keep the public or friends more entertained.

<summary><strong>Votes</strong></summary>

The users will vote for a side of their interest in a challenge. The side in a challenge who gets the higher votes is the winner. Both the winning voter(s) and challenger(s) will be rewarded in NFT with a ratio of 30% to 50%, respectively. The remaining will be distributed between Charanju and the judges.
