# Risk Factors

{% hint style="danger" %}
This NDB Whitepaper must not be regarded as a promotion for the sale or purchase of NDB and/or Watt tokens – or the utilities they provide access to. It is for information purposes only.
{% endhint %}

Purchasing our tokens involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty. Only use funds you can afford to lose. The sale of our tokens is aimed solely at persons who have sufficient knowledge and understanding of blockchain and cryptographic tokens and other digital assets, smart contracts, storage mechanisms (such as digital or token wallets), blockchain-based software systems, and blockchain or distributed ledger technology, to be able to evaluate the various and multiple risks of purchasing our tokens. Any purchaser of our tokens must be able to bear these various risks, including the risk of a complete loss of all amounts paid and/or all tokens purchased.

Any purchaser of our tokens must also be aware that the NDB Blockchain with its NDB and Watt tokens are no mere ad-ons to any existing blockchain or token system. Rather, they are built independently from other chains or systems. Any such new and independent developments typically involve a greater and particular level of risk.

Potential purchasers must make their independent assessment, after making such investigations as they consider necessary, of the merits of, and their suitability for, purchasing any of our tokens and should consult their accounting, legal, and tax representatives and advisers in order to evaluate the economic, legal, and tax consequences of purchasing our tokens.
