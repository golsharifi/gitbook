As we continue to evolve the NDB Ecosystem and all its components, as the regulatory requirements may change and as we are in the constant process of optimizing, improving, and stress testing our systems and as we are keen to be fully compliant in an evolving legal environment, we will amend from time to time this Whitepaper, the functionalities of the NDB Ecosystem and tokens that support it.&#x20;

We will update this Whitepaper and publish it on the website in case of change. It is your responsibility to check our website and the Whitepaper for any updates regularly.
