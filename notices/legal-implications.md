# Legal implications

{% hint style="warning" %}
No regulatory authority has considered the merits of or has given its approval to any of the information set out in this Whitepaper, nor has any regulatory authority considered or approved the accuracy or completeness of any of the information set out in this Whitepaper.&#x20;

This goes for all aspects of the Whitepaper: its energy-related ecosystem and the token system that supports it. While we are confident to have sought legal advice for confirmation, this Whitepaper's publication, distribution, or dissemination does not imply that the applicable laws or regulations have been complied with.
{% endhint %}

Neither Watt (_issuing company_) nor any of its officers, advisors, or stakeholders are liable for any direct or indirect damage or loss you may suffer based on the information shared in this or any future versions of the NDB Whitepaper or the [website](https://https/ndb.money).&#x20;

Given the many uncertainties relating to the issuance and operation of a blockchain-based business and token issuance and administration, no liability can be accepted for the full legal conformity of the NDB Ecosystem as outlined in this and future versions of the NDB Whitepaper.
