# Watt Token

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Watt (1).png>)

The Watt token provides access to most of the utilities offered by the NDB Ecosystem, in particular, most of its energy-related trading, tracking, and tracing features. This token is also a measuring and interaction tool for clients and users of our blockchain ecosystem.

The Watt token is not a security or representation by any means of Watt Green Ltdâ€™s shares or rights of any kind.

Watt is initially minted based on BEP-20 on the Binance Smart Chain network (Watt I). However, we plan to build on our blockchain to target millions of transactions per second at a modest transaction fee. Our blockchain network attempts to process the data to decrease the base layer's burden by adding smart contracts on the main blockchain protocol that interacts with activities off-chain.

{% hint style="success" %}
Once our blockchain is ready, the holders of Watt I will swap their tokens to Watt II (our blockchain network) at a 10% discount.

Watt tokens will be available for anyone willing to follow the KYC and AML procedures. This does not exclude users from buying Watt tokens in the open market. The rejection of these procedures will exclude a person from purchasing Watt tokens and accordingly accessing the products and services.

Watt token is a driving force of most applications of the NDB Ecosystem. This token will be a variable supply, burnable, and mintable. Through Watt token, the users will have the possibility to lease and access benefits from our products. Furthermore, the token can be used as an energy tracker for utility providers and consumers to earn rewards and incentivize the adoption of our products into the energy lifecycle. There are also plans for this token to be used as a form of energy payment in the future, thus incentivizing NDB staking so that users can earn Watt tokens as a result of proof-of-stake, which can be used towards paying their utility bill.
