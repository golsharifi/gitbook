<details>

<summary>Airdrop</summary>

Our Airdrop function is the initial incentive and compensation for people to stake their tokens into the Pools.

As the ecosystem grows, more features will be announced, guaranteeing advantages on-chain and off-chain for the user's interaction with specific Pools.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Recharge/Leasing Cycles</summary>

The Watt token will act as a recharge function for energy-generating products and services.

Since the products have a defined lifetime, the amount of Watt tokens required to reach the total capacity in each case is pre-determined.

</details>

<details>

<summary>WattShare</summary>

You can earn Watt tokens for the unused energy sent to the grid when the device is inactive. This is because some energy-generating products such as NDB Cell are constantly generating energy. For other devices meeting the characteristics described earlier, we will provide leasing offers within our blockchain.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Recycle</summary>

We have extensive attention to detail, and upfront, we are designing the incentive blockchain mechanism and anticipating product discard procedure.

</details>

<details>

<summary>The Retirement of the Tokens</summary>

When the user retires a device, the tokens powering it are retired at the lease renewal.

The amount minted when the device was conceived will be in circulation until the owner decommissions the device using the safety procedures. Then they will receive the remaining charge, in an equivalent Watt token, at the current kWh price, in their Wallet.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Burn/Retire</strong></summary>

Burning or retiring tokens is the action of concluding the token life purpose. This action will be executed in certain situations:

#### **Recharge/Leasing Cycles**

When the device is approaching the end of a leasing cycle or recharging, the device owner will have to submit Watt tokens from their Wallet for recharge by selecting the period, amount of energy, or time they want to keep their device cycle. This function could also be automatic.

#### **Decommission**

When the device is retired, the Watt tokens minted upon its creation will be removed from the circulating supply, guaranteeing that every ticket in circulation has a purpose.

If the action does not respect the two situations described above, the token shall continue circulation.
