# Minting

The creation of new tokens into the system is called minting. Watt tokens minting will be controlled and automated to integrate with the production line. Each new Watt will be minted when we conclude the addition of power (kWh) capacity to our network.

Out of the production line, each product will have an expected life cycle and power output which defines its power capacity. Similarly, the power capacity of any supplier joining our ecosystem is considered. Based on these characteristics, the NDB Hub will mint the tokens.
