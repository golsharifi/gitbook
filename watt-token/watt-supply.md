# Watt Supply

{% hint style="info" %}
The supply of 1,000,000,000,000 will be minted upon creation for liquidity purposes and to strengthen the market until our products start rolling out of production lines.
{% endhint %}

We will work with utility providers to begin our energy consumption tracking program and start including the amount of Watt on consumers' bills, thereby providing an option to "opt-in" to using the Watt token rewards program and payment systems.

We will also work with energy providers to begin the deployment of our products and services. Volt tokens can be pre-purchased at 0.05% cent higher than the cost of a kWh, thus establishing a baseline price for both the project and the cost of energy.
