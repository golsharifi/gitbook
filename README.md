# Abstract

{% hint style="info" %}
We propose a blockchain-based NDB Ecosystem that facilitates trading, tracking, and paying (and otherwise managing) energy in new ways – among peers and with personal devices, utility providers, and other stakeholders and components. At its center, the NDB Ecosystem is developed, managed, and governed by NDB Hub.
{% endhint %}

Through its blockchain protocol, NDB Hub will connect and, to various degrees, integrate all stakeholders and components in a way that aims to further the safe, clean and efficient generation, transmission, and consumption of energy.&#x20;

Through its blockchain-based interconnectedness, it strives to make a lasting contribution to the preservation of our environment, sustainability, and clean energy.

### Ecosystem

Among the features of the NDB Ecosystem will be:

_A Decentralized Energy Platform (Watt) that will provide software and blockchain applications as a service_

_An Energy Metaverse (NDB City) that will create a virtual reality focused on Energy-related topics_

_Energy technology projects that will enhance the self-sustained storing and sharing of energy among open user communities (e.g., NDB Cells)._&#x20;

> <mark style="color:green;">NDB Ecosystem promotes and facilitates energy-related projects that aim to improve the efficiency of energy generation, transmission, exchange, and consumption, with a particular focus on energy generation in a decentral manner, close to the location of consumption.</mark>

Two types of tokens will be issued to gain access to the NDB Hub-operated ecosystem – and to make use of the multiple products and services it intends to create: the NDB token and the Watt token.

As a dual token system, NDB and Watt tokens are interconnected and interchangeable with one another – as further specified in the token functionalities section of this Whitepaper. Whereas the NDB token provides access to the system and its utilities overall, the Watt token operates on a more granular level as a means of compensation for many of the NDB Ecosystem's services.

{% hint style="success" %}
This NDB Whitepaper will explain how the NDB Ecosystem will function with the NDB Hub at its center. It will also set out how the NDB and Watt token provide access to the NDB Ecosystem and its individual features, how the ecosystem and its components are governed, and how the tokenomics for NDB and Watt tokens works out.
