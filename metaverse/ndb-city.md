> Our metaverse begins with one city. The world will challenge its residents to develop and utilize their knowledge and skills to get more in their virtual life. There will be infrastructure and governance, which evolves in real-time.

You will be able to buy and trade land and other assets in the marketplace only with the NDB token. More information about each phase of the [NDB City](https://ndb.city) development will be communicated with the community throughout the development.
