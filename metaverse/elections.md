{% hint style="info" %}
Citizens of the NDB City may join the government through elections. Participants can become members of the House of community.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/elections.png)

Elections will be held every six months.&#x20;

Residents will have to meet the following criteria to become a candidate:

:id: Verified KYC/AML

:purse: Staking NDB tokenâ€™s equivalent to 5,000 USD

:clock1: Being an ecosystem participant for at least 1 Year _(Not enforced during 2022)._

:zap: Selecting their Staking Pools APR

{% hint style="info" %}
**NDB's default**\
_They will not provide any extra rewards and rely on NDB's generated staking reward_
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Additional Reward**\
_They can distribute NDB tokens to their voters_
{% endhint %}

Voters will stake their NDB tokens in the candidates' pools. This will represent their vote for a particular candidate. Every elector can vote for as many candidates as are interested in the House of community. A similar approach will be used for the mayor's elections.

{% hint style="success" %}
The chamber of representatives will consist of members of cabinets of ministers appointed by the cabinet itself. Each cabinet of ministers will elect one member to represent the city at the regional level by staking their NDB tokens to the candidate's pool.
{% endhint %}
