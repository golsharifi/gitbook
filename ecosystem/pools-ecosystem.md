#### Enterprise Pools <a href="#_toc98954644" id="_toc98954644"></a>

The companies that have access to our products will have production preferences and accessibility assessment preferences by the size of the NDB token stacked in the enterprise Pool. The enterprise Pools can be private or public depending on their preference.

Also, as a privacy feature, despite being a blockchain, the Pools have a mechanism to safeguard companies' trade secrets, including client profiles.

The enterprise's Pools became prominent on our blockchain by having many NDB tokens, and purchasers staked their money in the Pool.

#### Consumption Pool <a href="#_toc98954645" id="_toc98954645"></a>

The Consumption Pool is the total Pool of Watt allocated to a particular utility company's energy consumption. This is used as an account tracking pool where consumers validate the supply and demand.

{% hint style="success" %}
NDB Hub and participating utility providers manage the Consumption Pool. This appeals to utility providers because it offers them an incentive for drawing consumers into their service network through the Watt rewards program.

#### Electoral Pool <a href="#_toc98954646" id="_toc98954646"></a>

In NDB City, the electoral pools represent a candidate willing to participate in the election. The citizens can stake their NDB tokens under the candidate's electoral Pool. The staked tokens are considered votes for a particular candidate, and the electoral Pools with the highest staked tokens are the election winners.
