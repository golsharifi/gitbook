# Blockchain Ecosystem

{% hint style="info" %}
We will use blockchain technologies to provide our solutions to a wide public and make electricity available for everyone.

The advancement of Watt in power distribution networks will enable energy and data transfers. This allows traditional consumers to participate in energy trading also as providers. With the advent of blockchain, such users may engage in transactive energy markets more effectively, automatically, and without the need for a central controlling authority. As a result, transactive energy will be one of the most appealing blockchain applications.

Additionally, the surplus energy generated may be converted into Watt tokens and then traded within our ecosystem. This self-executing blockchain technology can reduce the cost of electricity and make it more available for everyone.

The decentralized market allows users to choose any electricity supplier they want and trade energy, profiting from their surplus. Users can produce and consume their electricity, manage their loads using peer-to-peer trading, pay for utility bills with our tokens within the ecosystem and earn additional tokens by staking them to the Pools. Consumers can respond to price changes and any events that affect the energy market.

The purpose of our ecosystem is to match the relationship between supply and demand, which would help the distributed energy market. By using blockchain services, users can monitor and create their energy supply within our ecosystem. This ecosystem of interactions between the users is our blockchain, and this white paper will provide you with all its features and explain how it works.
