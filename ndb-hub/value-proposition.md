NDB Hub and its components offer a unique opportunity to be a consumer and supplier of energy at the same time. Users can trade their surplus electricity within the NDB Ecosystem. For example, the process of electricity generation in the NDB Cell as one of the future products of the ecosystem runs continuously due to the nature of radioisotopes. Thus, the electricity generated while not used can be traded with the ecosystem. NDB and Watt tokens allow you to join this ecosystem and start using our decentralized medium.
