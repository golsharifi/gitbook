# NDB Hub

NDB Hub sits at the center of the NDB Ecosystem and its primary organization. It is ultimately responsible for its success. It is the governing body that oversees its day-to-day operations and the development of its programs, projects, and features. The NDB Hub is responsible for running the NDB Blockchain and administering the tokens and smart contracts that it issues – in line with this Whitepaper and its other defining documents and specifications.

{% hint style="info" %}
The NDB Hub aims to support innovation towards an efficient and effective generation, trade, and management of energy. It further seeks to support students, scientists, and entrepreneurs with the necessities to thrive and materialize their ideas that result in technologies that make a positive and lasting difference for our environment, our biodiversity, and our lives.

### NDB Hub Governance <a href="#_toc98954614" id="_toc98954614"></a>

The NDB Hub is, as such, not an incorporated entity. It is operated by Watt (see “[Operating Entity](../notices/operating-entity.md)”), as not-separately-incorporated organizational structure. Every discretion that the NDB Hub may exercise in certain situations depending on the circumstances is effectively exercised by Watt. The same goes for any decision taken by NDB Hub which will effectively be a decision by Watt.

The Hub is responsible for decisions safeguarding the NDB network's best interests, including approval, the admission of new participants, performing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Client (KYC) procedures, and managing the conversation with the community.

NDB Hub seeks feedback from the community and seeks product improvement where needed. The Hub will continue studying and improving with our current economists and nuclear scientists.

#### **NDB Blockchain**

The NDB Hub sets up the NDB blockchain that supports the success of the individual projects and programs built on it. It utilizes a consensus mechanism to validate cryptocurrency transactions. Within that system, a proof of stake consensus mechanism is used to allow owners of NDB tokens to use their NDB tokens for staking specific projects or other parts of the NDB Ecosystem and validate the transaction of this project or program.

> The NDB Blockchain will focus on supporting decentralized peer-to-peer transactions and exchanges of information and assets of all types. It will have an additional focus to be robust, trusted, and reliable.

#### **NDB Business Model**

The business model originates from conducting energy consumption assessments with participating utility providers and developing a tracking mechanism that uses tokens and expanded into an ecosystem that utilizes a trading model for electricity whereby energy exchange is conducted on the blockchain. By acquiring market share of the electricity generation and consumption, we can increase the influence and power to deploy our revolutionary solutions.

Over time, we have learned that we need a powerful ecosystem to be sustainable. With blockchain technology, we have the potential to create an ecosystem which participants that have never interacted before. Our ecosystem allows the creation of a new value by combining knowledge from diverse groups.&#x20;

NDB Hub, as the operating force of the NDB Ecosystem, intends to catalyze and promote the discovery of these values through various strategies. Through its oversight, they will harness diverse players' capabilities and channel them toward a common goal. Additionally, they should exhibit flexibility for continuous reconfiguration in the face of a fast-changing environment.

Likewise, the NDB Hub will facilitate the process of discovery by unlocking new values through new product bundles, new customer solutions, new platform economies, and the spawning of new industries.

The main components of the ecosystem run by NDB Hub will be outlined in the next section of this Whitepaper. Some of them will be presented briefly already here:

NDB and Watt are the tokens that allow benefiting from the utilities created by the NDB Hub and its parts. For this purpose, they allow access and acquire the goods and services provided by the NDB Hub. They also allow for certain staking options as defined in subsequent sections of this Whitepaper. We assume our developments within the NDB Ecosystem will perceive customer demand for solutions and experiences, raise knowledge content, and foster new opportunities leading to technological advancements.
