# Introduction

There are many concerns about the future of energy. The growing need for energy may substantially endanger our environment, biodiversity, and lives. Consequently, a shift towards clean energy and its efficient use is a necessity. Accordingly, policymakers, market participants, and consumers alike are looking for ways to achieve this.

{% hint style="info" %}
Promoting energy generation close to the sight of the consumption rather than at the large-scale centralized facility is one of those ways.

We have realized that the distributed energy future can start from single individuals living in villages to large cities and metropolises. Communities composed of such individuals can form an efficient and effective platform for the creation, trade, and consumption of energy.&#x20;

Blockchain technology is a useful tool to set up such a platform as it allows to connect and integrate all relevant stakeholders into a uniform, reliable and decentralized system.

> The NDB Ecosystem with the NDB Hub at its center is such a blockchain-based community for the purpose of creating, tracking, trading, (and otherwise dealing with) energy.&#x20;

The holders of the NDB's Ecosystem two tokens, the NDB token and Watt token, have access to the utilities of that platform. Through certain staking options, they can also support the ecosystem and express their preference for certain Energy related projects. Additionally, they can express ideas and preferences about presented proposals.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Such ideas and preferences shall not have any binding effect on Watt, the company that runs the NDB Ecosystem and that operates the NDB Hub as a dependent, legally, not separately integrated organizational structure. Accordingly, any ideas and proposals expressed by token holders are regarded to be suggestions with no binding effect from the community and its valuable members.

We very much appreciate every member of our community. Without you, we firmly believe our goal of building actual decentralization tools in the energy industry could never be accomplished.
