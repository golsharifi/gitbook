No participant holding an energy solution capable of generating energy will have the right to sell more energy than they can produce.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

For example, suppose our ecosystem in Switzerland has 58.6 billion kWh of electricity supply capacity. In that case, a total of 58.8 billion tokens are issued into the [Consumption Pool](../ecosystem/pools-ecosystem.md) - then they are distributed to participating users who consume energy directly through an application given/provided to the utility producers.

This form of tracking will allow users to stake these energy tokens back into the [Consumption Pool](../ecosystem/pools-ecosystem.md), where they will validate the supply and demand during the proof-of-stake and be rewarded until their next utility bill is received. The up-front costs of Watt will be 0.05% higher than the price of the energy itself to cover the costs of transactions.
