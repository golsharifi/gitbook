# Decentralized Energy Platform

Energy is essential as it provides almost all the necessary things that make our life easy, mobile, and more productive.

The conventional power solutions such as coal-fired, gas, or large solar power stations are usually government-controlled or privately owned, generating substantial electricity at centralized facilities. Those centralized systems were and still are powering most of the world's population as they distribute the electricity through the power grid to millions of end-users. However, such centralized energy generation has various disadvantages, including the transmission of electric energy over long distances, cost expansions, air pollutant emissions, waste generation, and more.

Despite the above drawbacks, one may ask why anyone should look for their energy while private companies or governments are handling it quite well in exchange for a substantial monthly or yearly consideration?&#x20;

> **The answer is straight forward:** \
> _<mark style="color:green;">The advancement of new technologies and global challenges are enforcing decentralized smart grids, which will become more desirable and feasible.</mark>_

Decentralized energy is the transformation of the distribution of the energy as we know it, having the potential to cross the lines between supplier and consumer and establish solid and smart connections between supply and demand. The energy can also be generated through a decentralized energy system where it is used rather than at the large-scale centralized facility, leading us toward smart generation, storage, and energy consumption.

> We believe decentralized energy distribution has significant advantages and is an up-and-coming model to bring sustainable energy to all since it delivers economic and practical benefits to both customers and producers.

{% hint style="success" %}
A decentralized energy system is characterized by generating energy as close to its use as possible. Accessible plug-and-play technology allows the consumer to consume energy as they need it.

Since the end-users are spread across the globe, sourcing decentralized energy generation can substantially reduce the transmission and distribution inefficiencies environmental costs. Decentralized energy can offer favorable pricing compared to conventional energy service providers. It also helps to reduce carbon or greenhouse gas emissions as renewable sources power many decentralized energy systems.

Furthermore, it can increase eco-efficiency by optimal energy use as the consumers will avoid unnecessary or wasteful energy use.

A decentralized energy system requires low maintenance and servicing.
