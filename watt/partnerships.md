# Partnerships

We have identified a variety of potential participants within Watt's ecosystem activities, and dedications can be categorized in five different ways.

> * Traders
> * Brokers/moderators
> * Governments/Policymakers
> * Consumer
> * Supplier

We will focus on suppliers and onboarding their technologies into our ecosystem in the following sections.

### Utility sector <a href="#_toc98954622" id="_toc98954622"></a>

Although the utility industry is full of centralized energy providers and despite their less advantageous energy supply, we consider forming a solid partnership with them, including those entities in the NDB Ecosystem, to provide mutual benefit for all.

> Once the utility sector is concerned, we foresee strategic partnerships with governments and the companies that create or provide electricity, independent power producers, renewable electricity providers, and many more.

The companies operating within the utility sector own thousands of grids and meters placed in the public and consumers' houses, respectively. Through the formation of the partnership, the grids and meters will be connected to the NDB Ecosystem, allowing consumers to simply get electricity from any person registered within the NDB Ecosystem rather than only from the supplier owning a grid or meter.

One of the main reasons local companies may gain by joining the NDB Ecosystem is the potential increase in their customers. The local companies usually provide energy within the limited geographic areas because they cannot power the entire country due to competitors or lack of financial capacity to cover large regions. However, the NDB Ecosystem offers customers access without limitations. The utility companies will interact with each other and form legal relations. Customers domiciled in one country may pay for the energy to a company based in another country. Still, an actual provider of the electricity will be the local company.

The NDB ecosystem, as far as regional regulations allow, takes local suppliers into the international arena and lets them compete, gain, and grow amongst other utility companies. It is the first time you will experience how money and energy become the same within the NDB ecosystem.

### NDB Cell

NDB Cell is a radioisotope electricity generator (REG) that can power applications over their lifespan and overcome some limitations of the existing energy generation. This will reduce the time and money spent recharging or replacing the battery.

NDB Cell is climate independent. It is a power source for devices that are expected to last for a long period or devices that are difficult to reach. Applications of NDB Cell span but may not be limited to most devices that currently use a battery.

There are three major components of an NDB: source, transducer, and encapsulator.

The radioactive source will emit radiation due to nuclear decay. The transducer is responsible for converting these radiations into usable electrical energy. The radiation hits the transducer materials, ionizes the atoms, produces electron-hole pairs, and generates electricity. The encapsulator prevents radiation leakage and stops overheating. The encapsulator material is robust and tamper-proof. The lock-in design ensure implanted isotopes are atomically caged to prevent misusage.

NDB plans to transfer the nuclear waste problem into a safe and clean power solution by this innovation.

### NDB Chantico <a href="#_toc98954624" id="_toc98954624"></a>

NDB Chantico is a high-efficiency radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG). The current RTGs have very low efficiencies, limiting their performance and applications. NDB is researching and developing materials necessary to reach higher efficiencies.

{% hint style="success" %}
The NDB Chantico enables the utilization of nuclear waste such as spent fuel into clean power.

Applications can include medium-range power and heating for communities.

### NDB Volta <a href="#_toc256000087" id="_toc256000087"></a>

NDB Volta is a compact and modular smart microreactor. It converts fission heat into electricity with power output in megawatts. The heat source is fission materials such as nuclear wastes in an advanced matrix structure. NDB Volta is planned to run a minimum of ten years without refueling.

NDB Volta will use heat pipe cooling. The fuel and heat pipes will be contained in a steel monolith to form a compact solid-state core. Its components can be built in the factory with no onsite construction. The NDB Volta will be small enough to be transported to offer high reliability and operational flexibility.

> NDB Volta will operate semi-independently and safely. Machine learning algorithms, in combination with sensors, monitor the core and reactorâ€™s condition. The solution will be designed to operate, predict, and handle failures with minimized human interactions during the operation.

NDB plans a demonstration plant to test the capabilities of the NDB Volta design. The demonstration phase could also involve testing various energy storage options such as hydrogen production.

The design certification and licensing would take a comprehensive amount of time.&#x20;
