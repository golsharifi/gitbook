# Our Solution

From our perspective, a decentralized distributed energy future starts from an individual to groups, entities, governments, and the entire world. To heavily contribute to this process, we plan to provide a tool for citizens to manage their energy use, generation, and active energy trade.

{% hint style="info" %}
Watt is a decentralized energy platform incorporating several novel functionalities. Watt allows energy sharing and trading with Watt token, an instrument for the energy produced by other utility providers or us within our ecosystem.

Watt is an opportunity for everyone to manage their energy use, generation, and active energy trade. Watt is a marketplace for grid or off-grid energy power solutions, allowing various solutions to coexist peacefully. Watt will enable participants to be solely or simultaneously a supplier or a consumer within our ecosystem.

<summary>Smart Subscription</summary>

Another significant feature for consumers and suppliers is a Smart Subscription within our ecosystem. NDB Smart Energy, composed of AI-based energy subscriptions accessible via Watt apps, intends to promote energy-saving and efficiency.

The subscription will optimize the energy consumption or the product's utilization period. The Smart subscription is the end of payment for the energy that eventually is not being used, stored, or consumed by the consumer. In the traditional model, consumers do not have the possibility of more optimal energy use to avoid unnecessary or wasteful use.

The AI will help consumers choose the cheapest or any type of supplier they consider appropriate within their financial or eco-friendly conditions. This further optimizes and advances the Smart Subscription model.

<summary>Trade</summary>

One of the options for the NDB Ecosystem participants could be to trade with the energy within the ecosystem by finding the cheapest offers and selling it to a higher price if the supplier has a consumer who is happy to pay the required consideration.

The energy is directly traded between two individuals who define prices, volume, and other terms in the negotiations. This could also lead to a futures marketplace that can advance investment in the energy sector.

<summary>Open Market</summary>

By being an open market competition, the suppliers can market their service by any lawful means. The NDB Ecosystem allows the suppliers to build a strong profile by providing offerings/awards and to receive evaluations, consumer feedback, and satisfaction.
